### Why choose EAM Property Investment?
“I want to work with someone I can trust, who is experienced and professional...”
• Working with a property company can help you to make the most of the opportunities available through property investment
• If and when you choose to work with any property investment company, it is vital that you work with people you trust
• At EAM Property Investment we are different from the other property investment companies out there, because:
‒ Your requirements come first: Our competitors frequently source properties, and then ‘hard sell’ them to clients. Instead, we go through a thorough consultation process to find out what will be the best investment for you, then find property that might suit your requirements
‒ We build relationships for the long term: We will never sell you something inappropriate, or guarantee a level of return just to make money. We are building long term relationships with clients, not looking for a quick buck
‒ Professional reputation and conduct: We are regulated by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, bound by their Code of Conduct, and will always be honest and transparent
‒ We’re realistic: Our case study illustrations are actual examples of deals we’ve been involved with, and are realistic – for example, we account for voids and contingency spending, to reflect the realities of property investment, because we’d rather exceed our investors’ expectations
