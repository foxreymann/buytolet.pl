If you are looking for an investment vehicle that can provide positive cash flow and access to capital appreciation, then we can help you invest in an asset where you have direct ownership. This will give you a greater degree of control over your financial future.
Our property sourcing service will help you to grow your financial worth over the long term, with minimal time, and effort required from you. But safe in the knowledge that a professional team of investment advisers are working with your best interests at heart.

We target high yielding, cashflow positive properties in the North of England. We have specific target geographic areas where we have detailed knowledge of the local property market, and an extensive network of property contacts. 
We source properties in high tenant demand areas with the intention of renting the property out for the medium to long term, i.e. 3 years plus. These areas may not have the potential for huge capital growth; however their steady income stream will allow a passive income to be built up, and will allow you the financial freedom to retire early, or pass on wealth to your children to secure their future. 
This property investment strategy has been used by the wealthy in all countries for hundreds and hundreds of years. 

Our ideal property is an existing 2 or 3 bedroom, 75 – 125 year old, terraced or semi-detached property. We do this because in the areas we target, this is the most popular property type with tenants. Older properties tend to be larger, better built, and more appealing to tenants. Whereas new build apartments and houses are generally more expensive to purchase, and are smaller in size. 
We generally aim to provide our Investors with a return on the cash they invest in the property of around 8% per annum. This figure does come with a number of assumptions, but we do include the most common costs that a landlord will face during the ownership of their investment property.
If you want to invest without finance, then the return may be fractionally lower, however you will have the security of owning the property outright and maximising your cashflow each month.

We are not responsible for the performance of an investment property you purchase through EAM Property Investment and you should seek financial and legal advice to ensure you understand the risks involved in property investment.
